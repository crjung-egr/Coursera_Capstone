    "The objective of this capstone project is to analyze and recommend where someone would like to visit or possibly even move to. Where someone might stay or live, and what kind of culture they would be surrounded by. The ease of access to various places such as markets, airports, train stations, restaurants, entertainment and other daily needs. So to help someone do so, you will first need to know where they want to go and from there narrow down their search by finding out what's around that area. Once you know where you want to go, using Foursquare API we can search around the area for things to do. "
